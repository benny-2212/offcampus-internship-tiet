# 💝 Romantic Surprise Dashboard for Suhani

A multi-page web experience disguised as a boring college form that transforms into a beautiful romantic surprise.

---

## Phase 1 – Fake College Form (Landing Page)

- Official-looking academic form styled like a Thapar Institute form
- Plain white background with blue accents, institutional typography
- Fields: Name, Roll Number, Branch (dropdown)
- On "Submit" → smooth transition effect (the boring form melts away into romance)

## Phase 2 – Valentine Question Screen

- Romantic pastel background with subtle floating heart animations
- Placeholder image spot at the top (easy to swap URL later)
- Big beautiful title: **"Suhani Bhutna, will you be my Valentine?"**
- **Yes 💖** button → proceeds to dashboard
- **No** button → playful popup: *"Oops! Wrong answer. Right answer only."* — stays on screen until Yes is clicked
- The "No" button will dodge/move away playfully when hovered

## Phase 3 – Main Romantic Dashboard

- Three elegant image cards in a centered layout
- Soft hover animations (gentle lift + glow)
- Subtle floating hearts in the background
- Each card links to its own page
- Placeholder romantic illustrations used throughout (easy to swap image URLs)
